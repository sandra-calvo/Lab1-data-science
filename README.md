# Introduction 
--> Introduce the workshop and maybe add a picture of how watson studio and the other services we are going to use in this workshop fit together.

# PHASE 1
# Data Preparation using Data Refinery

**Data Refinery** it’s a self-service data preparation client for data scientists, data engineers, and business analysts. With it, you can quickly transform large amounts of raw data into consumable, quality information that’s ready for analytics. Data Refinery makes it easy to explore, prepare, and deliver data that people across your organization can trust.
For more information: https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/docs/ibm-data-science-experience/data-refinery/ 

Refining data consists of cleansing and shaping it. When you cleanse data, you fix or remove data that is incorrect, incomplete, improperly formatted, or duplicated. And when you shape data, you customize it by filtering, sorting, combining or removing columns, and performing operations.

As you manipulate your data, you build a customized data flow that you can modify in real time and save for future re-use. When you save the refined data set, you typically load it to a different location than where you read it from. In this way, your source data can remain untouched by the refinement process.

# PHASE 2
# Data analysis using Modeler
**Modele: Flow editor** You can create a machine learning flow, which is a graphical representation of a data model, or a deep learning flow, which is a graphical representation of a neural network design, by using the Flow Editor. Use it to prepare or shape data, train or deploy a model, or transform data and export it back to a database table or file.


# PHASE 3
# Create your custom machine learning model


# PHASE 4
# Deploy ML model
**IBM Watson Machine Learning** is a full-service IBM Cloud offering that makes it easy for developers and data scientists to work together to integrate predictive capabilities with their applications. The Machine Learning service is a set of REST APIs that you can call from any programming language to develop applications that make smarter decisions, solve tough problems, and improve user outcomes.

# PHASE 5
# Create an application that uses custom ML model 
**Node-RED** is a visual tool for wiring the internet of things - connecting hardware devices, APIs and online services in a new and interesting way. Node-RED provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range nodes in the palette. Flows can be then deployed to the runtime in a single-click.


# PHASE 6
# Data science with Jupyter Notebooks in Python, R or Scala
A Jupyter notebook is a web-based environment for interactive computing. You can run small pieces of code that process your data, and you can immediately view the results of your computation. Notebooks include all of the building blocks you need to work with data:

    The data
    The code computations that process the data
    Visualizations of the results
    Text and rich media to enhance understanding
